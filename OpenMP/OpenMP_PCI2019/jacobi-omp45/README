OpenMP 4.5 offload jacobi example.
Notice this is only for NCSA Blue Waters.

The goal of this example is to show how 
to accelerate the jacobi example using OpenMP 4.5 
target offload on the BlueWaters xk K20x GPUs.
Your output should be the same as output.txt

The files are:
.modules  - this file contains the modules that are needed for this example onBlueWaters
jacobi-accel.f  - source code with OpenMP target offload
input.jacobi - input file. This file can be modified for different parameters
Makefile - Makefile that shows how to build the source code - it also shows examples of other compilers.
jacobi.sub - qsub script - (It should be invoked where the executable jacc.cray is)
output.txt - sample output when using input.jacobi

Instructions on how to compile and run this example

1. source .modules
2. gmake
3. qsub jacobi.sub
